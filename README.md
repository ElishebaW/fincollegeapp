The Financial College Application allows graduating High School students to compare colleges
based on the monthly cost of student loan payments.

This tool can be used to help students make informed decisions today based on future information.

Based on the monthly student loan payment, students may choose to search for scholarships, find a job while in school to help pay down future loan monthly payments while in the grace period, choose a less expensive college, or a variety of other choices!
